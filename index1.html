                    Combining magic, mysticism, wisdom, and wonder into an
                    inspiring tale of self-discovery, The Alchemist has become a
                    modern classic, selling millions of copies around the world
                    and transforming the lives of countless readers across
                    generations. Paulo Coelho's masterpiece tells the mystical
                    story of Santiago, an Andalusian shepherd boy who yearns to
                    travel in search of a worldly treasure. His quest will lead
                    him to riches far different—and far more satisfying—than he
                    ever imagined. Santiago's journey teaches us about the
                    essential wisdom of listening to our hearts, recognizing
                    opportunity and learning to read the omens strewn along
                    life's path, and, most importantly, following our dreams.

                      "The Room on the Roof" revolves around Rusty, a
                      16-year-old Anglo-Indian boy who feels alienated from his
                      strict guardian and the conformist society in Dehradun.
                      Seeking freedom and a sense of identity, Rusty befriends a
                      group of Indian friends, including the charismatic Somi
                      and Meena. Together, they embark on adventures,
                      experiencing the cultural richness of India. Rusty finds
                      solace and joy in these friendships, which challenge
                      societal norms. The novel explores themes of rebellion,
                      cultural clash, and the quest for personal freedom.
                      Rusty's journey becomes a poignant exploration of
                      self-discovery and the transformative power of genuine
                      connections, making "The Room on the Roof" a timeless tale
                      of adolescence and the search for one's place in the
                      world.

                      "Maharani" by Ruskin Bond is a novella that follows the
                      life of an eccentric and spirited Maharani in a small
                      Indian principality. The story unfolds through the eyes of
                      the young and observant narrator, as he becomes enamored
                      with the Maharani's unconventional behavior and her
                      ability to connect with nature and animals. The narrative
                      beautifully captures the Maharani's idiosyncrasies and her
                      impact on those around her. Filled with Ruskin Bond's
                      signature charm, "Maharani" is a brief yet enchanting tale
                      that explores the essence of individuality and the magic
                      that can be found in the most unexpected places.

                      Grievers is the story of a city so plagued by grief that
                      it can no longer function. Dune’s mother is patient zero
                      of a mysterious illness that stops people in their
                      tracks—in mid-sentence, mid-action, mid-life—casting them
                      into a nonresponsive state from which no one recovers.
                      Dune must navigate poverty and the loss of her mother as
                      Detroit’s hospitals, morgues, and graveyards begin to
                      overflow. As the quarantined city slowly empties of life,
                      she investigates what caused the plague, and what might
                      end it. In anguish, she follows in the footsteps of her
                      late researcher father, who has a physical model of
                      Detroit’s history and losses set up in their basement. She
                      dusts the model off and begins tracking the sick and
                      dying, discovering patterns, finding comrades in
                      curiosity, conspiracies for the fertile ground of the
                      city, and the unexpected magic that emerges when the debt
                      of grief is cleared.

                      Insignificance, James Clammer’s first novel for adults,
                      unfurls over the course of a single day. Placing the
                      reader right inside the head of its struggling narrator,
                      it works double time, both as an act of empathy - a taste
                      of the uncertainty and awkwardness of one vulnerable man,
                      and his relationship with the world - and also as a tense,
                      emotional and gripping drama. Exploring the burdens of
                      mental health as well as family life, as well as a
                      particular illness called Capgras Syndrome (a condition in
                      which someone comes to believe that a person close to them
                      has been replaced by an imposter) - Insignificance is a
                      deeply human story, a novel that portrays the thoughts of
                      one working man on his own terms, without artifice or
                      condescension… and a novel that takes us ever closer to
                      the edge.

                      In the near future, advances in medicine and quantum
                      computing make human cloning a reality. For the wealthy,
                      cheating death is the ultimate luxury. To anticloning
                      militants, it’s an abomination against nature. For young
                      Constance “Con” D’Arcy, who was gifted her own clone by
                      her late aunt, it’s terrifying. After a routine monthly
                      upload of her consciousness—stored for that inevitable
                      transition—something goes wrong. When Con wakes up in the
                      clinic, it’s eighteen months later. Her recent memories
                      are missing. Her original, she’s told, is dead. If that’s
                      true, what does that make her? The secrets of Con’s
                      disorienting new life are buried deep. So are those of how
                      and why she died. To uncover the truth, Con is retracing
                      the last days she can recall, crossing paths with a
                      detective who’s just as curious. On the run, she needs
                      someone she can trust. Because only one thing has become
                      clear: Con is being marked for murder—all over again.

                      OLIVE is many things, and it’s ok that she’s still
                      figuring it all out, navigating her world without a
                      compass. But life comes with expectations, there are
                      choices to be made, boxes to tick and – sometimes –
                      stereotypes to fulfil. And when her best friends’ lives
                      start to branch away towards marriage and motherhood,
                      leaving the path they’ve always followed together, Olive
                      starts to question her choices – because life according to
                      Olive looks a little bit different. Moving, memorable and
                      a mirror for every woman at a crossroads, OLIVE has a
                      little bit of all of us. Told with great warmth and
                      nostalgia, this is a modern tale about the obstacle course
                      of adulthood, milestone decisions and the ‘taboo’ about
                      choosing not to have children.
